          Hi<span class="animate-wave inline-block origin-bottom-left"><span class="transform scale-x-[-1] origin-center inline-block">üëãüèº</span></span>, I am Fayiza. I have got a sweet tooth for desserts since my childhood. Moving to UAE post marriage, I tuned my sweet tooth into not just devouring, but also baking them for my family and friends. The biggest appreciation for me was when all my guests say that they would definitely visit us again surely for the desserts if not for anything else. I also started capturing moments of my baking which brought me into food photography as well. Around September 2015, one of my guests wrote me a heartfelt thank you letter, signed by all ages in their family, appreciating my creations and also titling me the "Sweets Queen", which kindled me to also showcase my creations on to social media platforms as well.

          A food has so many factors that contribute to its success, and it ain't just its taste. And before all factors, the first factor is the visual treat - how it is presented. The first half of a food's victory lies there. That's what made me coin '<span class="text-highlight font-semibold">Mi</span>cro <span class="text-highlight font-semibold">C</span>oo<span class="text-highlight font-semibold">k</span>ing <span class="text-highlight font-semibold">Ma</span>cro <span class="text-highlight font-semibold">C</span>lic<span class="text-highlight font-semibold">k</span>ing', combining my passion for baking and the interests to showcase them.

          Not to forget, a special mention and thanks to the residents of The Promont, Bangalore who gave me a great support in the launch of my India edition of Mick Mack.
